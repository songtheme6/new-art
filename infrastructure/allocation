You will need to log in using an AWS account with access to EC2 instances.
AVX512 is necessary to build the project, which is available on r6i instances in AWS.

To perform the experiments in full, we recommend at least 512 GB of RAM.
For a scaled down version of the evaluation, you can use an instance with only 32 GB of RAM.

See the `resources` file for specific instance types we recommend.
